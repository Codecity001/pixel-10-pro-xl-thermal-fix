## v1.3-mustang.4

- Adds one additional VIRTUAL-SKIN throttling sensor to the stable v1.3-mustang.3 baseline: VIRTUAL-SKIN-CPU-ODPM PollingDelay 300000ms -> 5000ms.
- Keeps overlay scope limited to system/vendor/etc/thermal_info_config_throttling.json.
- Does not restore thermal_info_config.json or thermal_info_config_charge.json.
- Requires post-reboot runtime verification for fresh ThermalHAL tombstones.
# Changelog

## v1.3-mustang.3

- Rebuilt as a minimal live-stock-derived bisect release after ThermalHAL tombstones were observed with the broader overlay.
- Uses the live stock `thermal_info_config_throttling.json` from Pixel 10 Pro XL build `CP1A.260505.005/15081906` as base.
- Removes broad overlays for:
  - `thermal_info_config.json`
  - `thermal_info_config_charge.json`
- Changes only:
  - `VIRTUAL-SKIN-CPU-LIGHT-ODPM` `PollingDelay: 300000 -> 5000`
- Replaces self-disable loop counter with passive guard logging while AshLooper remains the primary bootloop protector.
- Keeps wrong-target boot-time disable for non-`mustang`/wrong fingerprint cases.

## v1.3-mustang.2

- Added guard grace counter.
- Still failed runtime validation on this device with ThermalHAL tombstones.

## v1.3-mustang.1

- Initial Pixel 10 Pro XL / `mustang` port.
- Narrowed to `VIRTUAL-SKIN*` semantic changes.
